| `my-react-app`                 | A base React project scaffolded with `create-react-app`.                   |
| `passwordGenerator`           | A customizable password generator with options for length and characters.  |
| `react-router(SPA)`            | SPA showcasing client-side routing using React Router.                     |
| `reduxToolkit-Todo`           | A Todo app built using Redux Toolkit for state management.                 |
